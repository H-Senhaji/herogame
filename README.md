What I've learned during this assignment:

Don't try and do several things in one time, I lose overview quick. It helps to split everything in little pieces.
Read carefully what is asked and check the game-logic tests to see what is tested. This shows pieces of code that I should implement in my own code so that when the 
test runs, it gives back what it expects.
If something doesn't work the way I expected it to work, I have to go back step by step (by console logging it) to narrow it down and find the problem.

Practicing some more with CSS wouldn't kill me.
